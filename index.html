            <p>  My favorite hobby is drawing! I always draw when I'm bored. It's fun and it relives stress. I think it's really fun and a lot of other people should start drawing! I also like it becuse it doesn't matter if you're good at it or not.  You can also play some fun drawing games with your friends or family. It can be a blast! So pick up your pencil and draw! :D That's all about my favorite hobby! </p>
